Tenzies game made with React. This project was inspired by the Scrimba React course. 
Functional components, hooks, and unified state were used in this project.

Tenzies is a game where you try to get 10 dice to all be the same value. In this version, you can click on a die to hold its value and reroll the others to eventually get all 10 as the same roll.
